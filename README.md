# Lift Operator 2022

* Extreme lift-operating action.
* Play as a lift operating software, managing payloads of passengers.

1. Passengers congregate on different floors, and start pressing the call button
2. The player chooses which floor to service
3. The max. payload of passengers load onto the lift
4. The requested floors then light up on the panel (the player can see the lift buttons)
5. When the player moves to a floor, passengers intended for that floor will disembark (and new ones will embark up the the max payload)
6. If a floor becomes overloaded, the game ends (some text about angry passengers, and realising taking the stairs is so much healthier, and removing the lift system)
7. The player can queue multiple floors to travel to in advance, however these can't be unqueued

### Controls
* `left-click` to select a floor from the panel.
* `F1` to toggle fullscreen.
* `F3` toggle debug (FPS).
* `Escape` to quit.
* `p` to pause background music.
